"A date picker with configurable datetime format where both date and time can be changed via the text field and the date can additionally be changed via the JavaFX default date picker. Also supports incomplete dates. First recall how the date picker normally works: - The user selects a date in the popup, which sets {@link #valueProperty()} to the selected date. - The converter ({@link #converterProperty()}) is used to transform the date to a string representation and display it in the text field. The idea is now to intercept the process and add an additional step: - The user selects a date in the popup, which sets {@link #valueProperty()} to the selected date. - The date is converted to a {@link TemporalAccessor} (i.e, enriched by a time component) using {@link #addCurrentTime(LocalDate)} - The string converter ({@link #stringConverterProperty()}) is used to transform the temporal accessor to a string representation and display it in the text field.
