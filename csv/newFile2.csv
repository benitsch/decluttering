"A date picker with configurable datetime format where both date and time can be changed via the text field and the date can additionally be changed via the JavaFX default date picker. Also supports incomplete dates. First recall how the date picker normally works: - The user selects a date in the popup, which sets {@link #valueProperty()} to the selected date. - The converter ({@link #converterProperty()}) is used to transform the date to a string representation and display it in the text field. The idea is now to intercept the process and add an additional step: - The user selects a date in the popup, which sets {@link #valueProperty()} to the selected date. - The date is converted to a {@link TemporalAccessor} (i.e, enriched by a time component) using {@link #addCurrentTime(LocalDate)} - The string converter ({@link #stringConverterProperty()}) is used to transform the temporal accessor to a string representation and display it in the text field.

"From the Bibtex manual: Pops the top two (string) literals; it changes the case of the second according to the specifications of the first, as follows. (Note: The word `letters' in the next sentence refers only to those at brace-level 0, the top-most brace level; no other characters are changed, except perhaps for \special characters"", described in Section 4.) If the first literal is the string `t', it converts to lower case all letters except the very first character in the string, which it leaves alone, and except the first character following any colon and then nonnull white space, which it also leaves alone; if it's the string `l', it converts all letters to lower case; and if it's the string `u', it converts all letters to upper case. It then pushes this resulting string. If either type is incorrect, it complains and pushes the null string; however, if both types are correct but the specification string (i.e., the first string) isn't one of the legal ones, it merely pushes the second back onto the stack, after complaining. (Another note: It ignores case differences in the specification string; for example, the strings t and T are equivalent for the purposes of this built-in function.)
