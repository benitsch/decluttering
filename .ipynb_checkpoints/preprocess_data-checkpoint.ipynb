We view a chain as a vertical hierarchy and thus refer to the previous node as parent and the next node is a child. <p> In usual implementations, nodes function as wrappers around a data object. Thus normally they have a value property which allows access to the value stored in the node. In contrast to this approach, the ChainNode<T> class is designed to be used as a base class which provides the tree traversing functionality via inheritance. <p> Example usage: private class BasicChainNode extends ChainNode<BasicChainNode> { public BasicChainNode() { super(BasicChainNode.class); } }\n",
