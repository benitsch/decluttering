There two possible modes: (1) When only <code>-Djabref.theme.css</code> is specified, then the standard <code>Base.css</code> that is found will be watched and on changes in that file, the style-sheet will be reloaded and changes are immediately visible. (2) When a path to a css file is passed to <code>-Djabref.theme.css</code>, then the given style is loaded in addition to the base css file. Changes in the specified css file lead to an immediate redraw of the interface. <p> When working from an IDE, this usually means that the <code>Base.css</code> is located in the build folder.

      "695 A date picker with configurable datetime format where both date and time can be changed via the text field and the date can additionally be changed via the JavaFX default date picker. Also supports incomplete dates. First recall how the date picker normally works: - The user selects a date in the popup, which sets {@link #valueProperty()} to the selected date. - The converter ({@link #converterProperty()}) is used to transform the date to a string representation and display it in the text field. The idea is now to intercept the process and add an additional step: - The user selects a date in the popup, which sets {@link #valueProperty()} to the selected date. - The date is converted to a {@link TemporalAccessor} (i.e, enriched by a time component) using {@link #addCurrentTime(LocalDate)} - The string converter ({@link #stringConverterProperty()}) is used to transform the temporal accessor to a string representation and display it in the text field. Inspiration taken from https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx-controls/blob/master/src/main/java/tornadofx/control/DateTimePicker.java\n",

      "791 Tests if we are running an acceptable Java and terminates JabRef when we are sure the version is not supported. This test uses the requirements for the Java version as specified in <code>gradle.build</code>. It is possible to define a minimum version including the built number and to indicate whether Java 9 can be used (which it currently can't). It tries to compare this version number to the version of the currently running JVM. The check is optimistic and will rather return true even if we could not exactly determine the version. <p> Note: Users with a very old version like 1.6 will not profit from this since class versions are incompatible and JabRef won't even start. Currently, JabRef won't start with Java 9 either, but the warning that it cannot be used with this version is helpful anyway to prevent users to update from an old 1.8 directly to version 9. Additionally, we soon might have a JabRef that does start with Java 9 but is not perfectly compatible. Therefore, we should leave the Java 9 check alive.\n",
